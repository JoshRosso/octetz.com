:postTitle: Hooking Mule into RabbitMQ
:postDescription: Getting started with hooking Mule into RabbitMQ 

= Hooking Mule into RabbitMQ

http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] is a messaging solution with a focus on persistence and routing. It's implemented in Erlang and is a quite popular message broker for large scale applications. RabbitMQ is implemented to leverage the AMQP protocol. For such a capable broker, it's remarkably easy to get bootstrapped and hooked into Mule. Getting bootstrapped and connected will be our focus in this post, so let's get started.

== Setting up RabbitMQ

You'll need to download RabbitMQ. After downloading, install RabbitMQ based on https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html[the installation guide for your platform]. Let's begin by starting RabbitMQ.

[source,shell]
----
rabbitmq-server
----

Your shell will then display RabbitMQ. Simply enter `ctrl + c` when you wish to stop the broker.

[source,shell]
----
            RabbitMQ 3.6.0. Copyright (C) 2007-2015 Pivotal Software, Inc.

            Starting broker... completed with 10 plugins.
----

RabbitMQ features a graphical plugin named rabbitmq_management. This will allow us to visually inspect our queues. Enable the plugin with the following command.

[source,shell]
----
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
----

Login to the management console at http://localhost:15672. The default username and password is `guest`.

== Setting up Mule

If you already have a Mule 3.7.0+ standalone instance, skip this section.

First, https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/public/org/mule/distributions/mule-standalone/[download a standalone Mule runtime from nexus]. I'll be using the 3.7.0.

[source,shell]
----
curl -O https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/public/org/mule/distributions/mule-standalone/3.7.0/mule-standalone-3.7.0.tar.gz
----

Unpackage the download; delete the package

[source,shell]
----
tar zxvf mule-standalone-3.7.0.tar.gz && \ 
  rm -v mule-standalone-3.7.0.tar.gz 
----

NOTE: From this point on, *I assume you've set* `$MULE_HOME` *in your environment* to the location of `mule-standalone-3.7.0`.

== Creating the Mule project

Using https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-esb-maven-tools[the mule-app maven archetype] generate a new project. Modify the package/artifactId names as you desire.

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.mule.tools.maven \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-mule-app \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.2-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=com.joshrosso -DartifactId=user-registration \
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.joshrosso \
  -DmuleVersion=3.7.0 -Dtransports=vm -Dmodules=http
----

I'll now refer to this project location as `$PROJECT_HOME`.

Remove the test case from the project. We won't be running any test cases in this example.

[source,shell]
----
rm -rv $PROJECT_HOME/src/test/java/*
----

Clean `$PROJECT_HOME/src/main/app/mule_config.xml` by removing all elements inside of the `main` flow and removing all unused namespaces.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd">

  <flow name="main">
  </flow>

</mule>
----

== Setup a service

Let's establish a producer flow exposed externally via http. Then we'll create a consumer flow that logs the payload. For now, we'll call the consumer flow via a `flow-ref` to verify the request is received.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="httpListener"
                      host="localhost"
                      port="8081"/>

<flow name="producer">
  <http:listener config-ref="httpListener" path="/*"/>
  <flow-ref name="consumer"/>
</flow>

<flow name="consumer">
  <logger level="INFO" message="#[message.payloadAs(java.lang.String)]"/>
  <set-payload value="User created"/>
</flow>
----

Start your must standalone instance if you haven't already, and deploy the application using maven's install command.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
mvn install
----

NOTE: In order for `mvn install` to deploy the package to your local mule standalone instance, `$MULE_HOME` must be set.

We'll now send a request in to verify the data is flowing before hooking into rabbit. After a call, we should see "User created" as our response and the payload we POST in the logs.

[source,shell]
----
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name" : "bob"}' \
  http://localhost:8081/users
----

== Connecting to RabbitMQ

We'll now use the https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-transport-amqp[amqp transport] to communicate with our RabbitMQ broker. First, we'll add the amqp transport to our `pom.xml`.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.transports</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-transport-amqp</artifactId>
  <version>${amqp.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

At the time of this writting, the newest `amqp.version` is `3.6.2`. We'll add this to our pom properties.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
  <mule.version>3.7.0</mule.version>
  <amqp.version>3.6.2</amqp.version>
  <mule.tools.version>1.2-SNAPSHOT</mule.tools.version>
  <jdk.version>1.7</jdk.version>
  <junit.version>4.9</junit.version>
</properties>
----

We'll add the amqp module to our namespaces and create an `amqp:connector` describing the connection to rabbit.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:amqp="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/amqp"
      xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/amqp http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/amqp/current/mule-amqp.xsd
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http/current/mule-http.xsd">

  <amqp:connector name="amqpConnector" host="localhost"/>
----

Let's setup a system where we'll publish new users to a queue and consume them from another flow. We'll add an `amqp:outbound-endpoint` to our producer flow that sends messages to rabbit. We'll also add an `amqp:inbound-endpoint` to our consumer flow responsible for reading messages off the rabbit queue.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<flow name="producer">
  <http:listener config-ref="httpListener" path="/*"/>
  <amqp:outbound-endpoint connector-ref="amqpConnector" queueName="NewUser"/>
</flow>

<flow name="consumer">
  <amqp:inbound-endpoint connector-ref="amqpConnector" queueName="NewUser"/>
  <logger level="INFO" message="#[message.payloadAs(java.lang.String)]"/>
  <set-payload value="User created"/>
</flow>
----

We can create this queue from the rabbit management console. Queues can be added from the 'Queues' tab. Be sure to spell the queue identical to your queue attribute in Mule.

image::rabbitmq_addNewQueue.png[width=500]

Now that we're all setup, let's redeploy.

[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

Now we'll make many more requests.

[source,txt]
---
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name" : "bob"}' \
  http://localhost:8081/users
---

If the queued messages are picked up properly, we'll see the payload output in our logs. 

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
INFO  2016-03-12 17:12:34,780 [[user-registration-1.0-SNAPSHOT].consumer.stage1.07] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: {"name" : "bob"}
INFO  2016-03-12 17:12:34,780 [[user-registration-1.0-SNAPSHOT].consumer.stage1.08] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: {"name" : "bob"}
INFO  2016-03-12 17:12:34,781 [[user-registration-1.0-SNAPSHOT].consumer.stage1.10] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: {"name" : "bob"}
----

Let's now return to the management console at http://localhost:15672. Checkout the overview area where you should now see some traffic has come through rabbit. You may need to send more requests if more than 60 seconds has passed.

image::rabbit-mq-message-rates.png[width=600]

That's it! In minutes we're able to spin up a rabbit instance and move data through queues. While this covers initial connection, checkout the section below for an example on ack / fetch config.

== Playing with ACK and fetch parameters

The `amqp:connector` allows for specifying how you'd like to ack messages that have been dequeued. For acking, we have 3 options when not leveraging link::https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/amqp-connector-examples#transaction-support[amqp transactions].

[cols="30,70"]
|===

| AMQP_AUTO | Default; When dequeued in Mule, ack is sent

| MULE_AUTO | When flow completes, ack is sent

| MANUAL | Must explicitly send ack or rejection

|===

Let's set the `ackMode` to `MANUAL`, forcing us to specify when a message gets an ack or rejection.

[source,xml]
----
<amqp:connector name="amqpConnector" host="localhost" ackMode="MANUAL"/>
----

In our receiving flow, let's ensure only ~50% of requests receive an ack. For all others, we'll reject and requeue the message.

[source%nowrap,xml]
----
<flow name="consumer">
  <amqp:inbound-endpoint connector-ref="amqpConnector" queueName="NewUser"/>
  <expression-component>
    flowVars['number'] = Math.random() * 100 + 1
  </expression-component>
  <logger level="INFO" message="#[message.payloadAs(java.lang.String)]"/>
  <choice>
    <when expression="#[flowVars['number'] &lt; 50]">
      <amqp:acknowledge-message/>
    </when>
    <otherwise>
      <amqp:reject-message requeue="true"/>
    </otherwise>
  </choice>
</flow>
----

Redeploy the application once again and send some decent load in. I'll use the following script the push 1000 requests through curl.

[source,sh]
----
for i in {1..1000}
  do
    curl -i -X POST \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name" : "bob"}' \
      http://localhost:8081/users
  done
----

You'll likely notice that even though we're processing and re-processing many requests, it still returns quite quickly. When returning to the rabbit console, you'll now see a different distribution of delivered messages vs acked messages.

image::rabbit-mq-message-rates-high-load.png[width=700]

Interestingly, you'll likely have 0 queued messages in the graph above due to the process being so quick. Let's see if we can change this.

image::rabbit-mq-queue-message.png[width=600]

We can throttle this by size with `prefetchSize` or quantity with `perfetchCount`. Let's now ensure our mule only fetches 100 records at a time. 

[source,xml]
----
<amqp:connector name="amqpConnector" 
                host="localhost" 
                ackMode="MANUAL" 
                prefetchCount="100"/>
----

Before our next test, let's also introduce a thread sleep of 1 second between each consumed request.

[source,xml]
----
<flow name="consumer">
  <amqp:inbound-endpoint connector-ref="amqpConnector" queueName="NewUser"/>
  <expression-component>
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    flowVars['number'] = Math.random() * 100 + 1;
  </expression-component>
  <!-- other message processors -->
</flow>
----

Let's now redeploy the application, send in the same 1000 request load, and monitor our activemq queued messages and mule logs. We should now see the fetch quantity totaling around 100 at any given time. Slowly, we should also see more and more messages being acked, thus we'll see less in the queue over time.

If you'd like to see the finalized project, feel free to link:https://github.com/JoshRosso/mule-rabbitmq-example/tree/hooking-mule-into-rabbitmq[clone it from my GitHub]. While there's a ton more to learn about RabbitMQ and amqp, I hope this proved to be a simple example on how to get bootstrapped, connected, and playing around with acks/fetchs. Best of luck in your messaging-filled future!
