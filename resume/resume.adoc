== Story

I always knew I'd like to focus my professional life around technology. Considering technology's massive scope, it was a challenge to find where to place my effort. Overtime I was provided the opportunity to work on more and more development projects. This is where I grew my affinity for software development. As my development skill set grew, I took on consulting and training roles that allowed me to do development work, yet still maintain a relationship with the technologies user base. As I continue to progress in the amazing world of software development I'm finding a desire to spend more time writing software and contributing to open source. I'm excited to see the amazing technologies that will come out of this flourishing world of software engineering.
